# Waterfall

## Background

The waterfall model was described by Winston Royce in 1970 as an example of what no to do.

- Waterfall was first written about 1970
- It was not called Waterfall until much later.
- Winston Royce was of the opinion that software development should have an allowance for repetition of phases.
  - This is the opposite of waterfall
  - He preferred ** Iterative models**

# Waterfall characteristics

-Waterfall is broken up into different phases:
-These are the phases highighted by the software development lifecycle (SDLC)

- Progress goes "down" in one direction
- Once you progress to the next phase, there is no going back to a previous phase

# Pros and Cons

# Pros:

- Waterfall is a plan driven model, which makes it easier for project managers to deal with. -** Project Manager**: Ensure that a project is completed on time and on budget.
  -Easier control and scheduling of the phases
  -Less ambiguity (if properly planned)

# Cons:

- Testing is not performed until the actual implementation (coding), which means problems cannot be proactively detected and resolved ahead of time
- Customers often have changing opinions and demands (requirements)
- Competitive environments can change priorities.
- High risk: no working software until late in the cycle.
- Complex projects can be difficult to handle.

# Where Waterfall is Suitable

Waterfall is suitable if :

- Clear, fixed, and well document requirements.
- Technology is well understood
- The project is small or short in duration
- Proper resource are available to support development.
- The project reuiqres you to deliver everything at once.
