# Software Developement Lifecycle

The software development life cycle is a process to follow when developing software. The SDLC defines the phase necessary for a project from its initial creation to deployment and maintenance.

# SDLC phases

1. Requirement Phase

   - Phase where planning for the upcoming project happnes
   - What needs to be developed?
   - What sort of functionality are we envisioning?
   - what is the project schedule going to look like?
   - Business Analysts (BAs) + Senio team members

2. Analysis Phase

   - Gather together documents (requirements) for the new system.
   - Resolove any ambiguities and inconsistencies in the requirement.
   - A software requirements specifications document (SRS) si created
   - Software and hardware requirements are formally defined.
   - BAs + Senior developers.

3. Design Phase
   -Outline technical details for the application:

   - Infrastructure
   - Database structure
     -System interfaces
     -User interfaces
     -Pseudo-code, diagrams, wireframs, etc..
     -System architects + Senior developers, UX designers

4. Development Phase

   - Developers write code and build the application based on the design documents.
   - Junior + Senior developers

5. Testing Phase

   - Equally as important as the development phase
   - The software is tested to find bugs
   - Bugs that are found are fixed.
   - the software at the end of the phase should meet the requirements laid out int the requirements and analysis phases
   - QA members (Testers) + Developers

6. Deployment Phase

- The application is deployed to dedicated servers for hosting it
- System Administrator + Developers

7. Maintenance Phase

- Ensure that the system is up and functional and has high availability
- Rosolve new issues (bugs) based on user projects
- Developers + System Administrators + Site Relability from the customer)

# Conclusion

These phase are a high level description of the software development lifecycle. The details depend on how we choose to follow the SDLC.

There are 2 main competing philosophies:

- Waterfall
- Agile.
